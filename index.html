                <h3>Professional Teaching Background</h3>
                <p>As an experienced international educator, I have taught high school Mathematics, Economics, and STEM in diverse cultural and academic environments, including IB Diploma Programme (DP), Advanced Placement (AP), and US Common Core frameworks. My journey has taken me through institutions like Kampala International School Uganda and American International School of Bamako, where I've taught courses ranging from AP Calculus and AP Statistics to IBDP Economics and Precalculus. I have also led departments, mentored teachers, and supported inclusive education initiatives through work with special needs students in Nairobi.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Inquiry-Based and Interdisciplinary Learning</h3>
                <p>I'm a strong advocate of inquiry-based learning and interdisciplinary education that connects math, economics, and real-world problem solving. In my classrooms, students engage in meaningful projects that build critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity—whether it's modeling economic systems using algebra or applying calculus to environmental issues. I also champion the integration of technology in teaching, using tools like Desmos, GeoGebra, and Python-based simulations to enhance student understanding.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Technical and Software Development Skills</h3>
                <p>In addition to my teaching background, I bring full-stack software development experience, with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I design educational tools, automate workflows, and build interactive web applications that align with curricular goals. My technical skillset enables me to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern technology—creating engaging digital experiences for learners and improving school operations through smart automation.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Vision and Collaboration</h3>
                <p>Whether in the classroom or coding a solution, I believe in the power of purposeful learning and thoughtful design. My goal is to contribute to institutions and projects that value innovation, equity, and student-centered growth. I'm open to collaborating with educators, schools, and organizations that seek to blend academic rigor with technology-driven approaches to learning.</p>
